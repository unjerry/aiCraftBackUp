The current 
textbook in linear algebra is very abundant, 
include the linear operator oriented approach, 
which is the currently best one I have ever seen.

This book will base on a computational oriented 
approach to the subject of the so called linear
algebra.Linear algebra is such a vast topic that
I'm having the most firghtened heart to output
what I have learnt so far in this amazing land.

In this book, the main goal is to answer all the
questions about those are not well pondered in the
traditional linear algebra course of any kind.
In the computational matrix theory there are plenty
ways of decompose the matrix, such as LU, QR, and the
most fundamental SVD decomposition.
While in the more math oriented linear course
the main topic are always in the most abstract way
as they move forward.
And the main concepts such as the Transpose, dule
space, determinant, trace and all other fundamental
but always treated just in a forced memorize level.

The main goal is to explain all the concepts in a 
more mathematical natrual and fun way, even the sudden
expose of a certain defination would be a very hard
problem to those first expose to the abstract algebra
world student just like me. So I'll try my best to
get every defination and notion in a smooth and more
reasonalbe way.

\section{Tensor oriented for computation}

\subsection{Examples of (a,b)-Tensor $\forall a,b \in \mathbb{N}$}

$\left[\begin{matrix}
            1 & 2 \\
            3 & 4
        \end{matrix}\right]$
is a (1,1)-Tensor which is often refer
as a matrix.

$\left[\begin{matrix}
            1 \\
            3
        \end{matrix}\right]$
is a (0,1)-Tensor which is often refer
as a vector.

$\left[\begin{matrix}
            1 & 3
        \end{matrix}\right]$
is a (1,0)-Tensor which is called the covector.

The covector are also know as the linear functional.
come togeter with the concepts that are
called the dule space and dule vectors.

\subsection{(0,1)-Tensor the vector}
